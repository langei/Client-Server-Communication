# Client-Server-Communication
A client and server code, written in Python, to allow communication between a single server and multiple clients that share an internet network.

Code was created in order for a server PC or Raspberry Pi to communicate back and fourth with multiple clients (Raspberry Pi's) sharing the same network. 
The server code is first run, then the client code. The code written here is adaptable, but takes input from a user on the server and shares it with each client.
